Watlow heaters undergo rigorous tests to measure reliability before they are sold to customers. 

One of these tests is to measure for heater failure through the continuous use these heaters at high stress levels. 

In the medium voltage section of the laboratory, 9 heaters undergo these failure tests, running continuously until they break.

Various datapoints are collected every four seconds and stored. 

Traditionally, it may take half a month to a few years to accurately gauge how long a heater will last before breaking. 

The goal of this project is to utilize previous data collected within the past 3 years to attempt to predict how long a heater will last before failure, thus minimizing testing time while hopefully also maintaining, or even improving, the accuracy of these measurements. 

This was done with a combination of machine learning and deep learning.
